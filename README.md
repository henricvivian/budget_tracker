# Budget Tracker project

This is a simple program for monitoring one's Budget, and it gives the user the ability to enter income and spending, examine the current Budget and expenses, and then quit the program.

# How to Use:

The costs dictionary is created with no entries when the program is first started, and the initial value of the Budget is set to zero.

The primary look of the program begins, at which point the user is presented with the following four options:
1. Enter 1 to add income
2. Enter 2 to add expense
3. Enter 3 to view current budget
4. Enter 4 to exit


Once the user makes a selection, the application will carry out the operation that corresponds to it.

If the user choose to include money in the budget, the computer will ask them to input the total amount of revenue, after which it will include it in the budget.

If the user choose to add an expenditure, the application will ask them to input the item's name and amount, after which it will deduct that amount from the total budget and add the expenses to the expenses dictionary.

If the user uses the 'view current budget' option on program's main menu, it will show both the current budget as well as a list of costs along with the corresponding amounts.

If the user chooses to exit the program, the program breaks out of the main loop and ends.

# Prerequisites
The application is written in python, thus you must have Python installed on your computer to execute the program.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
